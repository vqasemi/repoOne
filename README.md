# repoOne
new Repo for new project! 
This is a brief doc about this project.
In order to work and contribute easier i propose “git desktop”. Also keep in mind that there are some differences between svn and git so i guess it would be better to study some docs before going further. 
(By the way if you find any good docs you can share it here).
